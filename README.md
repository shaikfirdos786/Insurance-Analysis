# Insurance Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **end-to-end insurance data analysis**, starting from raw datasets and ending with meaningful business insights through dashboards.  
The objective was to go beyond visualization and understand **data structure, relationships, and core insurance metrics**.

The project covers:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Relational data modeling
- KPI calculation and trend analysis
- Business-focused dashboards

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, validation, and initial exploration  
- **MySQL** – Database creation, table design, relationships, and queries  
- **Power BI** – DAX measures, KPIs, trend analysis, and reporting  
- **Tableau** – Visual storytelling and dashboard presentation  

---

## Data Source
The datasets used in this project are available via Google Drive due to file size constraints.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Standardized date, text, and numeric formats  
- Performed data validation to ensure accuracy  

Clean data was treated as a non-negotiable requirement before analysis.

---

### 2. Data Modeling (MySQL)
- Created structured tables for insurance-related entities  
- Defined relationships to reflect real-world insurance data flow  
- Used SQL queries to validate joins and aggregations  

This step helped understand how policies, customers, premiums, and time dimensions connect logically.

---

### 3. Analysis & KPIs (Power BI)
- Built calculated measures using **DAX**
- Key metrics included:
  - Total policies
  - Premium trends
  - Growth rates
  - Customer and policy segmentation
- Applied time intelligence for trend-based insights  

Focus was on **why a metric exists**, not just how to display it.

---

### 4. Visualization & Storytelling (Tableau)
- Designed dashboards to answer specific business questions  
- Avoided unnecessary charts and visual clutter  
- Focused on clarity, flow, and insight-driven visuals  

---

## Key Insights
- Premium and policy trends over time  
- Customer and policy segmentation  
- Growth patterns across defined time periods  

(Exact insights depend on dashboard interaction and filters.)
